# About me

I like to work on difficult problems that matter. I was drawn to study statistics by the power to approach multitudes of diverse problems in a principled fashion, and to do what I truly enjoy - mathematics, coding, writing, speaking (teaching), and visualization. Further, I am in awe at the massive amounts of data and knowledge being generating across so many fields. I believe creativity thrives at the intersection of disciplines and the greatest breakthroughs will happen when people of diverse training and backgrounds come together to meet common goals. To that end, I found the program for me - Statistics with an emphasis in Informatics offered by the University of Arizona Graduate Interdisciplinary Program (GIDP) in Statistics. Now I'm at the University of Nevada, Reno serving as an assistant profressor of statistics. UNR offers an outstanding environment to teach, research, and enjoy the beautiful Sierra Nevadas.

## Developing and disseminating statistical informatic methods for precision medicine

My statistical research interests are primarily inspired by cutting-edge technologies and collaboratively-defined problems. Often these situations present numerous statistical and computational considerations. With this in mind, my proposed research program has essentially two themes to *develop and disseminate statistical informatic methods*: (1) works directed towards statistical audiences, with an aim for theoretical rigor and clarity of exposition, and (2) works, software, and education geared towards the end-users of these tools. Notably, with this interdisciplinary focus, there is a common theme in my work to produce effective, defensible solutions that can be easily understood by a broad audience.

## Blog

Occasionally, I like to talk about data analysis, visualization, statistics, R and 
related stuff in my blog [Statistical Informatics blog](/blog).
