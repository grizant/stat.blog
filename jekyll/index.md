# Welcome!

You've found my homepage. I'm an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the [Department of Mathematics & Statistics](https://www.unr.edu/math){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Nevada, Reno](https://www.unr.edu/){:target="_blank"}. Thanks for checking out my work! Please see more information below or by clicking the links above.

## Research interests

My statistical research interests are primarily inspired by cutting-edge technologies and collaboratively-defined problems. Often these situations present numerous statistical and computational considerations. With this in mind, my proposed research program has essentially two themes to *develop and disseminate statistical informatic methods*: (1) works directed towards statistical audiences, with an aim for theoretical rigor and clarity of exposition, and (2) works, software, and education geared towards the end-users of these tools. Notably, with this interdisciplinary focus, there is a common theme in my work to produce effective, defensible solutions that can be easily understood by a broad audience.

## Personal statement

I like to work on difficult problems that matter. I was drawn to study statistics by the power to approach multitudes of diverse problems in a principled fashion, and to do what I truly enjoy - mathematics, coding, writing, speaking (teaching), and visualization. I am in awe at the massive amounts of data and knowledge being generating across so many fields. I believe creativity thrives at the intersection of disciplines and the greatest breakthroughs will happen when people of diverse training and backgrounds come together to meet common goals. So I completed a degree in Statistics with an emphasis in Informatics offered by the University of Arizona Graduate Interdisciplinary Program (GIDP) in Statistics. Now I'm at the University of Nevada, Reno serving as an assistant profressor of statistics. UNR offers an outstanding environment to teach, research, and enjoy the beautiful Sierra Nevadas.

## Blog (not yet active, only two posts)

One day I'd like to really start blogging at my [Statistical Informatics blog](/blog).
