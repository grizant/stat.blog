## Developing and disseminating statistical informatic methods for precision medicine

My applied research interests are primarily inspired by cutting-edge technologies and collaboratively-defined problems. Often these situations present numerous statistical and computational considerations. My research program has essentially two themes to *develop and disseminate statistical informatic methods*: (1) works directed towards statistical audiences, with an aim for theoretical rigor, innovation, and clarity of exposition, and (2) works, software, and education geared towards the end-users of these tools. Notably, with this interdisciplinary focus, there is a common theme in my work to produce effective, defensible solutions that can be easily understood by a broad audience.
